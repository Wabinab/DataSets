# G2M Cab Presentation

The initial notebooks have two, `discovery.ipynb` and `discovery2.ipynb` respectively. 

The `weather` folder contains unfinished data about the `weather`. Also, they're not used hence will not be included in the Data Intake Report. 

One did not save new dataset from the first analysis notebook. One do save it on the second `discovery2.ipynb` but did not use that as analysis. Rather, that is used as a final product. 

There are some assumptions being mentioned directly in the notebooks (as you read through), and sometimes they're not noticed early these assumptions are wrong and are proven wrong at the end/middle of analysis. 

## Questions
- What is the business problem?  
Ans: To find out which company is worth investing in. 

- How did you prepare and perform your analysis?  
Ans: They're based on question-answer basis (unlike the usual hypothesis basis) mostly. Given 2/more columns of details, how are they related to each other? If they are relationship between, did they answer to whether one is worth investing in as opposed to another? Hypothesis also included, but they're not the main way of analyzing information.
